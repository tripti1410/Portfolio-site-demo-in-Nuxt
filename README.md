# Portfolio site demo in Nuxt

> My first Nuxt.js project https://ecstatic-ardinghelli-6c0827.netlify.com/

## Inspiration

I attended [VueJs conf](https://jsfoo.in/2019-vueday/) and then watched a talk by [Sarah Drasner](https://vimeo.com/348717993), in which she created a nuxt app in 45min. So to learn and experiment I created this app in 6hrs.

Used CSS blend mode inspired by [Una Kravets](https://vimeo.com/181110918) talk.

## Tech

- VueJs app(SSR)
- CSS Grid for layouts
- CSS blend mode for image and text
- Used plain CSS
- Used gitHub API

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
